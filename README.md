# CARMAX
CARMA-X is a fine-mapping method designed for admixed populations, leveraging ancestry-specific genotype data derived from local ancestry inference (LAI) tools or summary statistics generated by admixed GWAS methods, like Tractor. It features an innovative approach to estimate cross-ancestry linkage disequilibrium (LD) matrices, enabling robust modeling of ancestry-specific and shared genetic effects. CARMA-X effectively handles diverse genetic architectures and admixture scenarios, addressing challenges posed by LD variations across ancestries. 

## Vignette

The CARMA-X webpage `https://zikuny.github.io/CARMAX/` provides a detailed walkthrough for setting up and running CARMA-X, including step-by-step instructions and explanations. It guides users through fine-mapping analysis using an example dataset designed to simulate admixed populations, showcasing key features and outputs of the method.
