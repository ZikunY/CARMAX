# CARMAX
CARMA-X is a fine-mapping method designed for admixed populations, leveraging ancestry-specific genotype data derived from local ancestry inference (LAI) tools or summary statistics generated by admixed GWAS methods, like Tractor. It features an innovative approach to estimate cross-ancestry linkage disequilibrium (LD) matrices, enabling robust modeling of ancestry-specific and shared genetic effects. CARMA-X effectively handles diverse genetic architectures and admixture scenarios, addressing challenges posed by LD variations across ancestries. 

## Vignette

The webpage `https://zikuny.github.io/CARMAX/` provides a comprehensive walkthrough of running CARMA-X with an example dataset of simulated admixed populations.

## Example

To run the example, first download the example data from the repository to your local directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ZikunY/CARMAX.git
```

## Running the Example Code

Once the repository is cloned, navigate to the Example directory and run the demonstration script:
